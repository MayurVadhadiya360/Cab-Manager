# Cab Manager
In the Cab Management Application, Users can easily register, log in, and book rides, specifying pickup, drop-off points, and vehicle preferences. Drivers can also sign up, manage their availability, and update their profiles, including details about their vehicles. Additionally, the application incorporates features for ride history, feedback, notifications, an admin dashboard for system management, and robust error handling mechanisms.  These functionalities are seamlessly implemented using powerful Django features, including Django Models for defining the data structure, Views for handling user interactions, Forms for data validation and collection, Templates for rendering the user interface, URLs and Routing for smooth navigation, and the Django Admin Interface for centralized management and control.
